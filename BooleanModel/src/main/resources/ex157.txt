Mr Zelensky wants to hold direct talks with Russia to restore peace in the conflict zone, where the rebels have declared self-rule. An international peace plan remains largely unfulfilled.

Ivan Aparshyn, a defence adviser in Mr Zelensky's team, told the Ukrainian news website Obozrevatel that the defence ministry budget would be made "as open to the public as possible".

A major scandal over defence procurement erupted in February, at the height of the presidential election campaign.

It was alleged that the son of an ally of Mr Poroshenko had facilitated corrupt deals involving Russian military equipment sold to Ukrainian forces at inflated prices.

It prompted then-President Petro Poroshenko - defeated by Mr Zelensky in Sunday's election - to issue a decree ordering reform and transparency in defence procurements.

Mr Aparshyn, a veteran defence ministry bureaucrat, promised criminal investigations into figures suspected of corruption in the defence sector.

He also referred to Ukraine's severe setbacks during the conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the east, notably the losses suffered in Ilovaysk, Debaltseve and Crimea. On that score, he said, "no one is going to hide anything from anyone".

"Officials who took decisions or did not act where it was necessary to act will be prosecuted," he said.
