It was getting dark, and the wolves were starting to howl.

 

Then all of a sudden in the distance there was a light.  Who was living so deep in the woods?  She stepped up closer and saw that it was a cottage.  Yet no sound came from the cottage, only light from the windows.

“Hello?” she said, knocking softly on the door.  “Hello?” No answer.  The door was already a little bit open.  Slowly, she opened it more and stepped in.  “Hello, is anyone home?” 

She looked around.  What a mess!  A kitchen and living room on the first floor and a set of stairs.

“This cottage may be a big mess,” she thought.  “But it's a safe place for me to stay the night. Maybe if I clean up around here, I can earn my sleep.”
