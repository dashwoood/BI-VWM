This is the Fairytale story of  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. This Classic Tale is reimagined with a modern twist on what it means to be "Fair." It is brought to you by Stories to Grow by. 

 

Once upon a time, a princess named Snow White lived in a castle with her father, the King, and her stepmother, the Queen.  Her father had always said to his daughter that she must be fair to everyone at court.  Said he, “People come here to the castle when they have a problem.  They need the ruler to make a fair decision.  Nothing is more important than to be fair.”

The Queen, Snow White’s stepmother, knew how much this meant to her husband. At the first chance, she went to her magic mirror.  “Mirror, mirror, on the wall,” said the Queen.  “Who is the fairest of them all?”

“Snow White is the fairest of them all!” said the Magic Mirror.

 

“Mirror, mirror, on the wall,” said the Queen.  “Who is the fairest of them all?”

 

 “What?!” yelled the Queen.  “No one is more fair than I!  The Queen must have the best of everything - everyone knows that.  What could be more fair than that?”

“Snow White is the fairest of them all!” repeated the Magic Mirror.

 “What do you know – you’re a mirror!” roared the Queen.  And she stormed off. 

Still, the Queen was bothered.  So bothered was she that the Queen decided to be rid of the girl, once and for all.  “I cannot wait another day!” she declared.  The Queen called for her huntsman.  “Find a reason to take Snow White deep into the woods,” she said, pointing her long finger at the servant. “Then kill her.”

 

The Queen decided, “I must be rid of that girl once and for all.”

 

The huntsman was shocked!  But what could he do?  The next day he took Snow White into the woods.  As he drew his knife to slay her, Snow White turned around.

“Look at this,” she said, taking something out of her pocket.  “You have always been good to me.”  She held in front of him six perfect arrowheads that she had carefully shaped.  “Do you like them?” she said.  “They are for you.”

“Snow White,” said the huntsman.  “I cannot do this!”

“Do what?” said Snow White.

 

“Snow White,” said the huntsman.  “I cannot do this!”

 

The servant dropped to his knees.  “The Queen, your step-mother, ordered me to kill you,” he said.  “But I cannot!”

“She did what?” Snow White called out with alarm.

“You must run away!” said the huntsman.  “Now, far into the woods!  And never come back to the castle!”

Snow White turned and ran into the woods as fast as she could.  Deeper and deeper she ran.  It was getting dark, and the wolves were starting to howl.  She tripped and her skirt was torn.  Tall tree branches seemed to reach down to the very ground to grab her.  She was scratched, bleeding and scared, yet she ran on and on.

 

It was getting dark, and the wolves were starting to howl.

 

Then all of a sudden in the distance there was a light.  Who was living so deep in the woods?  She stepped up closer and saw that it was a cottage.  Yet no sound came from the cottage, only light from the windows.

“Hello?” she said, knocking softly on the door.  “Hello?” No answer.  The door was already a little bit open.  Slowly, she opened it more and stepped in.  “Hello, is anyone home?” 

She looked around.  What a mess!  A kitchen and living room on the first floor and a set of stairs.

“This cottage may be a big mess,” she thought.  “But it's a safe place for me to stay the night. Maybe if I clean up around here, I can earn my sleep.”

 

She looked around.  What a mess!

 

As she cleaned, she thought of someone she already missed.  A few years ago, before her father had re-married, she and a Prince who lived in the next kingdom were getting to know each other.  They would take long walks in the royal garden.  What stories they would tell each other as they laughed the day away!  

After the Queen had moved into the castle, her stepmother had made a new rule – no more visitors.  Now the Prince had to slip over the palace gate in secret.  He would call out to her from under her window.  They could talk a bit that way.   It wasn’t as good as the long walks, but it was the best they could manage. 

Now that she had run away from home, would she ever see him again?

After Snow White cleaned up the downstairs, she went up the stairs.  Before her were seven little beds lined up in a row, as if for children.  Tired from cleaning, Snow White yawned and lay across all seven of the beds.  Soon she fell fast asleep.
