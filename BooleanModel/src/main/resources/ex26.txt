Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the ailing 82-year-old president of Algeria, handed in his resignation on live TV on the evening of 2 April.

Unlike previous promises to resign, this time it was effective immediately.

He was frail and silent. This was one of the very few times he had been seen in public in the last six years since he had a stroke in 2013 that left him partially paralysed and severely speech impaired.

It followed six weeks of peaceful, but increasingly urgent protests across the country, which were characterised by youthful crowds, considerate clean-up projects and witty signs.

Mr Bouteflika had led the country for 20 years - which, in a country where it's thought about 70% of the population is under 30, makes him the only president many people have ever known.

'One down, more to go'
Nourhane Atmani, 19, tells BBC News that she went to almost all of the recent demonstrations.

"The past couple of weeks have been causing me, and thousands of other Algerians, a lot of anxiety and anger," she says. "So today, waking up knowing our efforts didn't go to waste definitely felt liberating. We've been waiting for this moment for a long time."
