Ms Mooney was employed in Nigeria as a communication specialist for the non-governmental organisation Mercy Corps, which said it was "utterly heartbroken".

Neal Keny-Guyer, Mercy Corps chief executive, said she had worked with the company for almost two years "leading efforts to counter hate speech and violence" in Nigeria.

He said the graduate of University College London and the London School of Economics, who had previously worked in Iraq and Kosovo, was "an inspiration to us all".

Police said there had been no claim of responsibility for the incident and the kidnappers were yet to be identified.

A spokesperson said a group armed with dangerous weapons had gained entry to Kajuru Castle and began shooting sporadically, killing two people and kidnapping three others.
