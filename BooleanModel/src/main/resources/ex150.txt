"When we are talking about a prototype," he said, "The most important thing is to create a sensation. As much sensation as possible."
The Countach prototype created an immense sensation. Every Lamborghini since has been influenced by it. Even the current Lamborghini Urus, a modern SUV, has design elements taken from the Countach.
Most Lamborghini competitors have also taken inspiration from it as well, at least indirectly. While the Miura is generally called the "first supercar," due to the mechanical lay-out under its metal skin, the Countach created the enuring visual style of the modern supercar.
