The company unveiled computer hardware for what it said was "full self-driving" capabilities in the form of the new microchip.

There are still technical and legal challenges ahead for driverless cars, which currently are not deemed as sophisticated or roadworthy as cars with drivers, nor safe enough for public roads.

Mr Musk said its custom-designed chip was the best available and a significant milestone in self-driving.

Tesla's vehicles are not yet at the standard of autonomy needed to earn the tag "self-driven".

Level 4 autonomy means a vehicle can drive itself with a human on standby, with level 5 the standard needed before it can be called truly autonomous of human agency.

No Tesla car is at either level so far.

Mr Musk had promised previously that self-driving cars would be on the road in 2018.
