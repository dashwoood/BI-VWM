It was ultimate product of Gandini's experimentation with the wedge. It started with Alfa Romeo Carabo concept of 1968. As he sat in the museum recently, Gandini insisted this shape was just "in the air" at the time. It was a general geometric theme designers were playing with.
"In this case, with the Carabo in 1968, we began to forget these shapes that were more pleasing to the eye for things that were much harder, more extreme," he said.
Things became even more extreme with the Lancia Statos HF Zero in 1970. Looking at that car, it's almost hard to imagine that it is, in fact, a drivable automobile. Instead of doors, the cabin is entered through the upward swinging windshield. For driving, rear visibility is afforded by a temporary rearview mirror that attaches to the nearly horizontal windshield.
