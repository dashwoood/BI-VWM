'She hugged me to protect me'
"I never gave up on her because I always had a feeling that one day she would wake up," Omar told the newspaper on Monday.

"The reason I shared her story is to tell people not to lose hope on their loved ones; don't consider them dead when they are in such a state," he added.

"My mother was sitting with me in the back seat. When she saw the crash coming, she hugged me to protect me from the blow."
