Hospital row
A year later, her son was involved in an argument in her hospital room, which seemed to prompt his mother to stir.

"There was a misunderstanding in the hospital room and she sensed I was at risk, which caused her a shock," Omar said.

"She was making strange sounds and I kept calling the doctors to examine her, they said everything was normal.

"Then, three days later, I woke up to the sound of someone calling my name.

"It was her! She was calling my name, I was flying with joy; for years I have dreamt of this moment, and my name was the first word she said."

She became more responsive, and can now feel pain and have some conversations.

She has returned to Abu Dhabi, where she is undergoing physiotherapy and further rehabilitation - mainly to improve her posture when sitting and prevent muscles from contracting.
