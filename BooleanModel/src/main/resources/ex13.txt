From series like Making a Murderer to podcasts like Serial - true crime seems to be everywhere these last few years.

I put my hands up and admit it - I'm an addict.

For reasons even I don't understand, crime documentaries have become my default way to unwind.

If I have friends over, I might make an embarrassed joke about my streaming suggestions - but the evidence suggests I'm not alone.

The genre's growth is inescapable. Almost every week there seems to be a new documentary released and not without controversy.

Some warn we risk glamorising notorious killers and erasing their victims with the coverage. Others have accused programme makers of being selective with evidence.

So, do victims and the communities directly affected, think our fascination with true crime is problematic?
