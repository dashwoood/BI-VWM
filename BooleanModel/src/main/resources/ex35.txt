The Republican president has branded the accusations "fabricated" and "FAKE NEWS!"

In Tuesday morning's tweet, the US president accused Mrs Gillibrand of being a lackey to Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer.

"Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office 'begging' for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump," the US president posted.

Mr Trump did not explain what he meant by "do anything" for campaign contributions.

He added that the New York senator, who took over Hillary Clinton's Senate seat when her term ended, had been "very disloyal" to the Clintons and had been "USED" by them.

Last month, Mrs Gillibrand said former President Bill Clinton should have quit over his affair with a White House intern. A top Hillary Clinton aide called Mrs Gillibrand a "hypocrite" for that attack.

Responding to Mr Trump's tweet on Tuesday, Mrs Gillibrand wrote: "You cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office."
