“Do you know how to read?” asked Doc.  And so it was agreed that Snow White would give them reading lessons at nights and on the weekends. 

To celebrate their new friendship, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs sang and danced the night away. 

The next morning before they left for work, the Seven Dwarfs warned Snow White that she must not open the door to anyone.  After all, who knows what evil the Queen might do?  The princess nodded in agreement, and the Dwarfs left the house.  That day she got ready her first reading lesson.  She also made a good hot meal for the Seven Dwarfs when they returned home that night.  And so the days passed.
