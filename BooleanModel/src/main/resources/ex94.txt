Election-watchers are also likely to take an interest in Congress's 37-year-old Sherkhan Pathan, the state's only Muslim candidate.

Muslims account for around 9% of the state's population, but Gujarat has not elected a Muslim MP since 1984. Only three of the five Muslim candidates who contested state polls in December won.

However, Mr Pathan argues that it isn't his religion which won him his place on the ballot.

"I've been chosen to run because I'm young and represent a wide variety of voters here - not because I'm Muslim," Mr Pathan told BBC Gujarati.
