Former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn has been re-arrested in Tokyo while out on bail pending trial over claims of financial misconduct.

Prosecutors said the 65-year-old had been detained over suspicions he caused Nissan 5m (3.8m) in losses, according to reports.

In a statement, Mr Ghosn said his re-arrest was "outrageous and arbitrary".

Mr Ghosn's lawyer told a news conference they would strongly appeal against the latest arrest.

Junichiro Hironaka also said that Tokyo prosecutors had confiscated the passport and mobile phone of Carlos Ghosn's wife, Reuters reported.

Mr Ghosn, who denies any wrongdoing, was recently released on bail after 108 days in custody.
