Mr Palmer's early fascination with classic cars went into overdrive in 1954 when he was taken on as an apprentice mechanic in Kirriemuir, working much of the time on pre-war vehicles.

"I declined to stay at school, much to my mother's disgust - she had me as an architect or something," he says with a smile.

In 1960, Mr Palmer was called up for National Service with the RAF before returning to the garage trade several years later.

He found a lot had changed in his absence.

"I had been brought up in an environment where you would overhaul engines or gear boxes or whatever yourself, but by the time I got back everybody had more or less become spare parts fitters," he says.

"I didn't find that interesting at all. There was no challenge to it - it was all pre-determined by somebody else."
