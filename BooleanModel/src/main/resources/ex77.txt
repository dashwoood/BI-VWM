Why does WhatsApp pose a unique problem?
Indian fact-checking websites like AltNews and Boom frequently debunk political posts shared on Facebook and Twitter - such as reports that a British analyst of Indian elections had called Congress leader Rahul Gandhi "stupid" or that an air force pilot seen as a national hero had joined Congress.

These posts, while not promoted by official party accounts, are often spread widely by unofficial groups or people supporting the parties. They are then sometimes shared by politicians.

"Facebook and Twitter are platforms that do not allow too much secrecy which allows fact-checkers like us to trace who the bad actors are in many of the cases," said Jency Jacob, the managing editor of Indian fact-checking site Boom.

The difference with WhatsApp is that posts there are private and protected by encryption. Mr Roy likened it to "something of a black hole".

"No-one, including WhatsApp itself, gets to see, read, filter or analyse text messages," he said.

This is unlikely to change - the company said it "deeply believes in people's ability to communicate privately online".
