More success at Celtic - McNeill the manager
McNeill briefly took charge of Clyde and Aberdeen before returning to Celtic to succeed Jock Stein - under whom he enjoyed his many successes - in 1978.

His first season came to a memorable conclusion, when Celtic's 10-men came from behind to beat Rangers on the final day of the campaign to win the title.

McNeill left for City in 1983, securing promotion to the English top flight in his second year, before joining Aston Villa in September 1986, with both sides ending up relegated that season.

His second spell as Celtic boss began impressively as he delivered a league and Scottish Cup double in the club's centenary season, 1987-88.

However, a four-year stint would yield just one more trophy, the 1989 Scottish Cup.

Seven years after leaving the dugout at Celtic, his last taste of management came at Hibernian in 1998, where he stood in for one game during a brief stint as director of football at Easter Road.
