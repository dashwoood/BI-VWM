This week Singapore's government proposed its anti-fake news law in parliament - the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill.

The government says the law is necessary to protect Singaporeans from fake news and educate them about potential damage it can cause - in particular inciting racial and religious disharmony.

But critics say this new law puts too much power in the hands of the Singapore government, potentially threatening civil liberties.

Government decides what is factual
Under the new law Singapore's government will determine what is factual news and what is not.

If there is content about public institutions the government says is false, it can issue corrections that must be published, though it is yet unclear the exact process of how that would happen.

In extreme cases, it can tell online platforms to remove content it deems false.
