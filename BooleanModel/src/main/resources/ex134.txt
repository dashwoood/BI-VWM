ECA's ranking looks at average hotel prices for a four-star hotel. Other factors taken into consideration include transport, taxis and meals.
"Some of the ones that have dropped out of the top 10 [were ones] we expected, just given the market itself year on year. These cities and locations follow trends," says Sarwar.
Luanda, in Angola, is one of those spots. In 2018, it appeared at number four on the list. This year, it's dropped out of the top 10.
"It's always had an extremely high cost of living [and when it comes to] good-quality, expat-friendly hotels, the price of them has been extremely high. But as the country's economy stabilizes, the general security risk in the country improves, the hotel prices will drop. More hotels will pop up and then there'll be a bigger supply and less pressure on the prices to stay high."
The daily rate for each city was measured by ECA in US dollars. By this ranking, London remains just outside the top 10.
It's hard to predict how Britain's political instability will impact the cost of visiting the city going forward.
"Any time we have a Brexit announcement, the pound normally depreciates," says Sarwar.
"London might be less attractive for businesses, which means hotel prices might drop here," he adds.
Swiss cities remain costly, with Geneva taking the number two spot on the list and ranking as Europe's most expensive city for business travelers.
