The Independent Group was formed after eight Labour MPs and three Tory MPs left their parties in February.

The three Conservative MPs blamed "a shift to the right" in their party and the government's "disastrous handling of Brexit", while Labour MP cited their party's stance on leaving the EU, along with the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism.

In March, the group applied to become a party with the name Change UK and was given approval in April, meaning they could field candidates in the European elections.

After about 3,700 applications, 70 candidates were picked, including ex-BBC correspondent Gavin Esler.
