The Countach melded elements of both cars. It had a wedge shape, doors that opened upwards like they did on the Carabo. Rear visibility in the first Countach production model was through a sort of periscope built into the roof of the car.
A black Countach stands at the entrance to the Museo Nazionale dell'Automobile's Gandini exhibit. It is his masterpiece, the car of which he is clearly most proud. When asked about it, his usual modesty broke down just a bit.
"Maybe I shouldn't say this," he said, "but nothing better has been done since."
"Marcello Gandini. Hidden Genius," is on at Museo Nazionale dell'Automobile in Turin until May 26, 2019.
