Amateur James Cahill pulled off the biggest shock in Crucible history as he completed an astonishing 10-8 first-round win over five-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan.

O'Sullivan trailed 5-4 overnight and the increasingly rattled world number one slipped 8-5 behind, missing countless simple chances against the 23-year-old qualifier.

A jaded-looking O'Sullivan then somehow found some form, scoring breaks of 104 and 89 to level.

But 23-year-old Cahill, who does not even have a world ranking, showed remarkable composure under pressure to get over the line.

"I could barely stand up at the end," the Blackpool potter told BBC Sport. "I am not really sure what to say.

"I scored a good pressure 70 to go 6-5 up and after that I felt like he was the one under pressure. He didn't want to lose to me.

"I have always believed in myself and that I can beat anyone on my day. I want to show what I can do now."
