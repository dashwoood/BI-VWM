There's growing concern in northern Nigeria over the level of banditry and kidnapping in the state of Zamfara.

In a recent video, local journalist Kadaria Ahmed, has hit out at the government over what she claims to be a surge in killings there.

"Every day we bury between 30, 40 and 50 people," she said in the video, first broadcast on television and then widely shared on social media.

She said there were more killings taking place than in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, areas in north-eastern Nigeria affected by Islamist militants Boko Haram.

So what's going on in Zamfara, and are levels of violence increasing?s
