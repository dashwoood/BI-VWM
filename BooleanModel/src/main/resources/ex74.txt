What's the scale of the problem?
India poses a particularly complex problem for Facebook. It is WhatsApp's largest market - more than 200 million Indians use the app - and a place where users forward more content than anywhere else in the world.

The fact that up to 256 people can be part of a group chat makes it incredibly popular with extended families and large groups of friends. While much of these daily conversations involve people making plans, sharing jokes and catching up - political messages and videos are also shared widely.

BBC research last year found that a rising tide of nationalism was driving Indians to share fake news. Participants tended to assume that WhatsApp messages from family and friends could be trusted and sent on without any checks.

"In the past year we have been seeing a great deal of polarisation," he said. "A few people were incessantly sending out fake stuff. Some of us would do fact checks and tell them off but we were ignored. Finally they were suspended. Things have improved but it's still tense."
