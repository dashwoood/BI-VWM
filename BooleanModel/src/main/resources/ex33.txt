What's been the reaction?
A number of candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have backed Ms Flores.

Senator Elizabeth Warren said Mr Biden "needs to give an answer", and Senator Amy Klobuchar said that in politics "people raise issues and they have to address them".

Asked how the allegations might affect Mr Biden's possible future presidential bid, Ms Pelosi told Politico: "I don't think it's disqualifying."

But she added: "He has to understand in the world that we're in now that people's space is important to them, and what's important is how they receive it and not necessarily how you intended it."
