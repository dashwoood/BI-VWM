You get more time to focus on individual words. When a text is short, you can devote more time to learning how every single word is used and what importance it has in the piece.
You can read a whole story in one sitting. Attention spans are very important for learning, and the ability to finish a story gives you more time to digest it. Short stories are designed to give you maximum information with minimal effort.
It is best for consistency. It is far easier to read one story every day than trying to read a big novel that never seems to end.
You can share them easily in a group. Since short stories can be read in a single setting, they are ideal for book clubs and learning circles. Most of the time these groups do not work because members have no time to read. Short stories are the perfect solution.
You can focus more on ideas and concepts. Language is less about words and more about the meaning behind them. If you spend all your time learning vocabulary and grammar, you will never be able to fluently speak a language because you will have little to talk about. These short stories give you the opportunity to understand big ideas in context.
