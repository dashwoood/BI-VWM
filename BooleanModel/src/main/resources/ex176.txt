Today, the company's clients are a mixture of wealthy collectors and less well-off enthusiasts.

Restoring a classic car to its former glory can be an expensive business.

The owner of a Bentley S1 Continental has already spent 90,000 on restoration work at Alyth - and there's still work to be done on the bodywork.

"Six figures is not unusual for a restoration," says business operations manager Graeme Johnstone.

"We had one client spend over 400,000.

"Some customers like that wee extra touch to individualise their car.

"For example, we have a 1932 Phantom II which has been fully restored with a few modern tweaks - it's got an overdrive, power steering and a reverse camera on the back."
