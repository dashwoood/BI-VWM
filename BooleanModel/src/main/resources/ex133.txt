2018's list only included two American cities, with New York taking the top spot and Washington DC coming in at eight.
This year, Washington's risen up the list to number four -- while West Coast cities Los Angeles and San Francisco are new entries, in ninth and seventh place respectively.
"US cities -- the dollar's being doing quite well -- have moved towards the top of the list," says ECA's benefits and daily rates analyst, Qasim Sarwar. "There's high demand there."
Also new on the list for 2019 is Reykjavik, Iceland. It seems Iceland's capital's isn't just pricey for tourists.
Sarwar tells CNN Travel Reykjavik's ranking is due not only to the high cost of living -- but the way tourism and business work together.
"Hotel occupancy rates have been improving [in Reykjavik] with less supply -- and demand is high there," he says. "So hotel prices have increased and that's a big part of the daily rate allowance."
