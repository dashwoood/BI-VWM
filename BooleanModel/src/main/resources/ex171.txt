Plaudits & politics - McNeill after football
McNeill, awarded the MBE in 1974, is in the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame and the Scottish Football Hall of Fame.

He was voted Celtic's greatest captain in a 2002 fans' poll and the following year stood as a candidate for the Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party in the Scottish Parliament election.

McNeill was given a Celtic ambassador role in 2009 and a statue of him lifting the European Cup was erected at Celtic Park in 2015.

"Celtic has been in my blood and a part of my life for so many years and to be recognised in this way, by the club I love, is truly humbling," he said at the time.

In May 2017, McNeill was able to attend an event at Glasgow City Chambers, to mark the 50th anniversary of Celtic's triumph over Inter Milan in Lisbon.
