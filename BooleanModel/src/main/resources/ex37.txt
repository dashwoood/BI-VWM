Pressure from Renault
The latest arrest comes after Renault publicly criticised its former star executive for the first time, accusing him of "questionable and concealed practices".

Mr Ghosn only resigned from the French carmaker in January, while Nissan and Mitsubishi removed him as chairman shortly after his arrest.

Renault had initially questioned Nissan's allegations, but carried out its own internal inquiry.

But on Wednesday, it piled pressure on Mr Ghosn when it accused him of "violations of the group's ethical principles".

The carmaker said it would stop Mr Ghosn's pension, thought to be worth ˆ765,000 a year, adding that it reserved the right to bring action against him in the courts.

Renault said it had also "informed the French judicial authorities of potential issues concerning payments made to one of Renault's distributors in the Middle East".

However, in an interview with French TV stations TF1 and LCI, Mr Ghosn - who holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship - said: "I am innocent. It's hard, I have to admit it, and I call on the French government to defend me, and to defend my rights as a citizen."
