The cocktail Betye Saar offers in this 1973 work is a homemade incendiary device: a Molotov cocktail made from a wine jug. Its label shows a smiling mammy figure on one side, a black power fist on the other. Saar recasts the mammy figure as an agent of armed resistance against racism, a woman who has liberated herself.
Simplifying art for the sake of politics
In the years following the death of Martin Luther King Jr., Saar began using art to express her outrage at the pervasive discrimination against black communities. In 1972, prompted by an open call for black artists to show their work at Rainbow Sign in Berkeley, California, she exhibited her first Aunt Jemima piece: a mammy figurine holding a grenade in one hand, a gun in the other.
"I feel that The Liberation of Aunt Jemima is my iconic art piece. I had no idea she would become so important to so many," Saar explained in an interview with Artsy in 2017. "The reason I created her was to combat bigotry and racism and today she stills serves as my warrior against those ills of our society."
