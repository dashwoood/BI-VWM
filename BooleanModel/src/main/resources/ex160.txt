Police said the public response to the killing had been "massive".

Det Supt Jason Murphy said there had been a "palpable change" in community sentiment in support of their investigation, in terms of off-the-record intelligence.

He has urged members of the public to "come forward and have a conversation with me".

It is understood that police and the Public Prosecution Service have discussed what measures could be available to protect witnesses fearful of giving evidence at trial.
