A woman in shiny red shoes sashays down the street in Pipilotti Rist's "Ever is Over All." She cheerfully smashes the windows of each parked car she passes. Instead of stopping her, a female police officer pauses and salutes the vandal. The Swiss artist's film is a joyful paean to the destruction of authority and liberation from the norms of feminine "good behavior."
A more pointed variation on the theme (often compared to Rist's) is the music video for "Hold Up" from Beyonce's 2016 visual album "Lemonade."
"I tried to be soft, prettier," Bey admits at the beginning of the song, before she stops trying to please and starts gleefully smashing parked cars with a baseball bat. The video offers the same exhilaration as Rist's, the notion that anger itself might free us from everything from cheating spouses to systemic racism and sexism.
When Beyonce's bat busts open a fire hydrant, children frolic in its spray, and when she smashes a car's windshield, an explosion erupts, silhouetting her in fire like an avenging angel. But what's most striking is her lack of apology. She grins and grimaces, smashes and struts, as rage becomes her, after all.
