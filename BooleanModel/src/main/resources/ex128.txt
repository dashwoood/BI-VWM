Snow White bolted awake.  The Seven Dwarfs could tell she was as surprised as they were.  Soon they all relaxed and shared their stories.  Snow White learned their names – Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, and Sneezy. She told them all about her step-mother.  That she had tried to get the huntsman to kill her, that the huntsman had set her free in the woods, and that she could never go home again.

“Stay here, with us,” said Bashful. 

“That’s sweet of you,” said Snow White.  “But if I were to stay here at your home, I would have to do something for all of you.”

“You already cleaned up our place,” said Sneezy. 

“Keeping the house clean will be easy,” said Snow White, “as long as we all pitch in.  I will let everyone know what to do, and I will do my share too, of course.”

“That’s fair,” said Happy.

“There must be something else I can do for you,” said Snow White.
