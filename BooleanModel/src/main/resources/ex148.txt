If Marcello Gandini had only ever designed those two automobiles and no others he would be remembered. But he did far more. Just a part of his work now fills an exhibit at the Museo Nazionale dell'Automobile in Turin, Italy. The museum is not far from Gandini's home. It's also near the auto design firm he worked for, Bertone.
Besides his work for Lamborghini, Gandini designed rally racing cars, economy hatchbacks, at least one helicopter and many concept cars. They all have only one thing in common.
"I always loved things that moved," Gandini said, speaking Italian. "Not static objects. They never attracted me."
His interest in automobiles was, at the start, mechanical rather than aesthetic. When he was five his father bought him a Meccano set, the metal building toy known as an Erector Set in the United States.
Children could build cars, airplanes and machines with the thin metal sheets and bars held together by tiny nuts and bolts.
