The nearly 40% efficacy is not high in comparison with vaccines for other diseases, but Dr Schellenberg says RTS,S will add to the preventative measures, such as bed nets and insecticides, already being used.

"Nobody is suggesting that this is a magic bullet," Dr Schellenberg said.

"It may not sound like much but we're talking about 40% reduction in severe malaria which unfortunately still has high mortality even when you have good access to good treatment," he added.

Dr O'Brien said the vaccine lasted for at least for seven years and would target infants because they are most at risk.

The vaccine needs to be given four times - once a month for three months and then a fourth dose 18 months later.

Dr Schellenberg accepted that it might be a challenge for mothers in some areas to take their children to clinics for all four doses.
