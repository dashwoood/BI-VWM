Dorrit is a child whose father has been in prison ever since she could remember. Unable to pay their debts, the whole family is forced to spend their days in a cell.

Dorrit thinks about the outside world and longs to see it. This excerpt introduces you to the family and their life in prison. The novel is about how they manage to get out and how Dorrit never forgets the kindness of the people who helped her. 

What Is Great About It: Injustice in law is often reserved for the poor. “Little Dorrit” shows clearly how it works in society. It is about the government jailing people for not being able to return their loans, a historical practice the writer hated since his own father was punished in a similar way. The story reveals how the rich cheat the poor and then put them into prisons instead of facing punishment.
