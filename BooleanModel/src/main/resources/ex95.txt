The BJP, which argued that the ruling was an attack on Hindu values, was accused of exploiting the issue to court its mostly-Hindu support base.

The party has been trying to make inroads in the state for some time now but it has never won a seat in Kerala. This time its contesting 14 of the 20 parliamentary seats. The rest have been left to regional allies.

What are the key issues in this election?
The economy and jobs are perhaps the two biggest issues.

The government has invested heavily in infrastructure, but it hasn't produced the desired economic boost - annual GDP growth has hovered at about 7%.

The farming sector has stagnated and a leaked government report suggests that the unemployment rate is the highest it has been since the 1970s.

In fact, Mr Modi's government has been accused of hiding uncomfortable jobs data.
