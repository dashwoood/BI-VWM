At 18 Gandini became a mechanic. A wealthy friend with a Fiat OSCA 1500S he liked to race asked Gandini to work on the engine. Gandini decided to alter the car's body as well, a project that became his entrance into automotive design.
In 1965 he joined the Turin-based auto design firm Bertone. His first project, a body that went over a Porsche 911's chassis and engine, was exhibited at the 1966 Geneva Motor Show. That car was sold at a Gooding & Co. auction in Pebble Beach, California, for $1.4 million in 2018.
The starting point for all his designs, Gandini said, was purpose. Each suited a need.
Prototypes, or concept cars, were his favorites, he said. They gave Gandini the opportunity to create entirely new automotive forms. He loved the opportunity to start from a clean sheet of paper. And, in these cases, the need was simple.
