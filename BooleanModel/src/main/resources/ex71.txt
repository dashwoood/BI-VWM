One false rumour that has resurfaced this month claims that prosthetic fingers are being used to allow people to vote multiple times.

The idea here, presumably, is that you'd dip the fake finger in the ink, then return to vote again using your own real finger, or perhaps another fake finger.

How can the fake news problem be tackled?
Although some social media organisations have begun to devote resources to tackling viral fake news, it is an immense task.

The flow of information in private networks cannot really be controlled despite efforts by social media platforms, says Professor Usha Rodrigues, from Melbourne's Deakin University, who studies social media and Indian politics.

For those inclined to believe a story, "they may not believe the information is false even after it's been debunked", she says.

"And the social media machinery of political parties may continue to insert the false information in their distribution of various messages for political gain."
