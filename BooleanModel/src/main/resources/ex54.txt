Is it a boy or a girl?
Who knows!

It's unclear if the couple have even found out, but if they have it's definitely not public knowledge.

Meghan told well-wishers during a royal visit to Merseyside in January that they didn't know the sex of the baby.

But betting fans think they have the answer: a girl.

That's the odds-on favourite with the bookmakers. A William Hill spokesman said: "The gamble on a girl continues and it is hard to believe that there is not some truth in the rumours."

Where will Meghan give birth?
Remember the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stepping outside the Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London?
