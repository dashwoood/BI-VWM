I don't think I'm alone in this; Renaissance and Baroque depictions of Judith beheading Holofernes, Orpheus being ripped apart by Maenads, and Timoclea tossing her rapist down a well have been popping up on my Instagram and Twitter feeds for weeks. They've become memes; recontextualized and captioned, they give voice to women's rage at the injustices of the present.
In her book "Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women's Anger," Rebecca Traister challenges her readers to Google the name of any powerful woman in politics -- particularly those who challenge white male power and authority -- to find a cache of images of that woman yelling angrily.
"The best way to discredit these women, to make them look unattractive, is to capture an image of them screaming," she writes. "The act of a woman opening her mouth with volume and assured force, often in complaint, is coded in our minds as ugly."
