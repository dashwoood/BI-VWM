Professor Chong also refers to Clause 61 which, according to the draft bill, "enables the Minister to exempt a person or class of persons from any provision of the Bill".

The way the law is worded suggests the government "can exempt anybody from this act that they want," he says. The fear is that if power is abused, the law leaves open the possibility that a government official would not be brought to account for potentially spreading falsehoods.

Is going against the government realistic?
The government says that if you do not agree with their decision, there is always a judicial review open for you.

"The government is not the final arbiter of truth" Mr Shanmugam says in a Facebook post, in an attempt to clear up misconceptions about the proposed law. "If the person who puts it [the content in question] up says, no this is true, this is not false, then challenge it in court...The courts are the ultimate arbiters of the truth."

But Kirsten Han, editor of New Naratif, a regional-focused news site, says that's not a realistic option for most Singaporeans who don't have the time, money or the will to go up against the government.

"I would question the number of alternative sites and Singaporeans who would have the resources to take the government to the high court in an attempt to overturn a minister's direction," she said.
