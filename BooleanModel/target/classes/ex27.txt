"As a kid, every single adult around me would glorify him, as though he's some sort of god who saved the nation from terrorism, and he's the saviour everyone has been waiting for after 10 long years of [conflict] for Algeria," she says.

"So once I grew up and started becoming more politically aware, I honestly was angry at the previous generation - it was them who kept making him out to be this great holy person, it was them who kept him on the chair [in power] and gave him the confidence to never step down."

She adds that with many of the old guard still firmly in place, the protests are not going to stop.

"When 'he' supposedly announced his stepping down, I exhaled for the first time in forever. One down, more to go."

Disillusioned
Fellow protester Abdellah Djelti, 27, agrees that Mr Bouteflika was seen as "a white knight, a saviour" for Algeria in the first few years of his presidency.

"Algeria in the civil war, it was a disaster," he tells the BBC. "People couldn't go out - if you went out... you'd find bodies outside."

Mr Bouteflika, he adds, was seen as the man who stopped this.

But after four terms in office, mired by corruption, allegations of vote-rigging and an increasingly absent leader, people became frustrated.
