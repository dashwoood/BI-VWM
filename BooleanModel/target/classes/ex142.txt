Academic French painter Jean-Leon Gme's take on the allegorical figure of Truth (specifically, the philosopher Democritus's aphorism: "Of truth we know nothing, for truth is in a well") differs from contemporary interpretations in a number of ways.
A beautiful nude woman emerges from a well, an open-mouthed shout of anger on her face and a whip in her hand, rather than the usual mirror. Although she is nude (a blunt reference to "the naked truth"), she looks ready to charge straight for the viewer in a full-throated battle cry.
Nude art and censorship laid bare
Apparently, Gme intended the piece as a commentary on the positive impact of photography on painting, a fairly limited metaphor. ("It has opened our eyes and forced us to see that which previously we have not seen," he wrote.)
Yet today, the painting has become a popular meme, due both to its unusually vivid depiction of female anger and its overall weirdness. Truth's nudity reads here as power and moral purity rather than sexual availability; her fury makes her dangerous.
