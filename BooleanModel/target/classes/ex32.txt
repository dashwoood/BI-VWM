'Clearly there's a line'
By Katty Kay, Presenter, BBC World News in Washington

Former Vice-President Joe Biden's reported behaviour is what used to be described as "touchy feely". He is known to be physical, with everyone. He is also known as one of the most empathetic politicians around - the guy who calls when you have a problem, and just listens.

But now two women say the "touchy" behaviour was a problem and the "feely" behaviour was inappropriate. This needs context. Physical contact with supporters has been a necessary part of political campaigning for decades. The candidate who tries to run for office and refuses all physical contact with voters would soon be dismissed as cold and aloof.

So clearly there's a line politicians have to walk. Physical but not in the wrong way. And I'd posit that most women know exactly which side of the line any physical contact falls on - appropriate or inappropriate. We just know it. And women my generation put up with inappropriate contact for years, assuming it was part of the cost of having a job in a largely male environment.

Younger women are less tolerant. Thank God. They have much less tolerance for men behaving badly. In many ways this is a story of generational differences.
