The technical vocabulary and foreign words make this text a little more difficult. However, the story is relatively easy to follow.

What Is Great About It: It is no secret that governments lie to their own people. But sometimes these lies can cost lives. Very often we accept this as normal, but this tale opens our eyes to the cost of our indifference.

The story is divided into small parts that make it both easy and exciting to read. The various events are about life in general in what was then known as the Soviet Union. And just like any other good story, it is also about human relationships and how they change due to historic events.
