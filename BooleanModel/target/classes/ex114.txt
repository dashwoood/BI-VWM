Sly is a chimpanzee who is much smarter than other beings of his kind. He loves to play with clay on a potter’s wheel all day and likes to keep to himself. But one day when the school kids bully him, he loses his temper and acts out in anger. Seeing this, the teacher punishes him and takes away his clay.

What Is Great About It: Sly is a character who does not fit into society. He is too smart for the other chimps, but humans do not accept him. He is punished for acting out his natural emotions. But the way he handles his rage, in the end, makes him look more mature than most human beings.
