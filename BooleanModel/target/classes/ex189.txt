How much influence does Moscow have over North Korea?
The Soviet Union was a major ally of North Korea, offering economic co-operation, cultural exchanges and aid. It also provided North Korea with its initial nuclear know-how.

But since the collapse of the Iron Curtain the relationship has suffered. With weakened ideological ties there was no reason for special treatment and support. And as a regular trading partner, North Korea was not very attractive to Russia, as it was unable to pay international market prices.

Since Russia's gradual estrangement with the West since the early 2000s, relations have picked up somewhat. Moscow has found itself backing countries "based on the old logic that my enemy's enemy is my friend," explains Professor Andrei Lankov of Seoul's Kookmin University.
