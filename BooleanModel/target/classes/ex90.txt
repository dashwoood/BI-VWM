Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cast his vote in his home state of Gujarat in the third phase of the country's general election.

He led what appeared to be a roadshow on his way to the polling booth in Ahmedabad, the city he lived in during his 13 years as chief minister.

He waved at the crowds that had gathered from an open-top jeep, which had replaced his usual bulletproof car.

Mr Modi is contesting from Varanasi, which goes to the polls on 19 May.

Around 180 million people are eligible to vote on Tuesday - 117 seats spread across 15 states and union territories are up for grabs. It is the largest stage of the whole election, which is being seen as a referendum on Mr Modi, who has been in power since 2014.
