Even though Mr Bouteflika has stepped down, it's clear the protests are far from over.

"It's scary," Ms Atmani says. "I'm happy [Algerians are now] aware, but then I'm also afraid there's going to be a major split in ideologies when it comes to choosing who's to become president."

Mr Rahmoune agrees, but he's more hopeful about the future: "We hope to see new faces and more youth in parliament, so we have a lot to do."
