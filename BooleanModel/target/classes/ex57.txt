Police in Nigeria are investigating the deaths of 11 people in the north-eastern town of Gombe after a car ploughed into a procession celebrating Easter on Sunday.

The driver, an off-duty security agent, was unhappy that the procession had blocked the road, some reports say.

He then "drove into the children", the procession leader said.

The crowd then turned on the driver and beat him and his passenger to death, witnesses said.

Nigeria's police chief said the incident was "unfortunate" and that the driver had lost control of the car.
