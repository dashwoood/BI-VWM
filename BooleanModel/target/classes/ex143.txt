A more explicit re-thinking of the female body as a weapon rather than a sexual object comes in the form of "Action Pants: Genital Panic." In 1968, the self-named Austrian performance artist Valie Export entered an art house cinema in Munich wearing crotchless trousers, her hair teased into a wild mane.
By walking through the theater and confronting the audience with her exposed genitals, she sought to challenge viewers to engage with a real woman, rather than look passively at the objectified images of women onscreen.
The following year, to commemorate her performance, Export posed for a photograph. She's shown with her knees spread wide and crotch exposed, holding a gun and staring down the camera with the panache of a guerilla fighter. Here, Export draws a clear comparison between a weapon of war and the inescapable fact of female sexuality.
