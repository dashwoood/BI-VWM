The museum found that both paintings were covered with a varnish that wasn't there before and had yellowed over time. Conservators removed the layers of varnish and retouched the paintings.
In the process of removing varnish from "Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen," they discovered another varnish layer that Van Gogh likely applied himself. It is protein based and marks the first time that such a varnish layer has been found in the painter's early work.
The museum also selected new frames for both paintings because the thieves removed the previous ones.
