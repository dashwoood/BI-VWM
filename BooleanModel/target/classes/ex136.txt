The paintings, which date from the 1880s, underwent conservation treatment before they returned to public display.
Stolen Van Gogh paintings found after 14 years in raid on Italian mafia group
"View of the Sea at Scheveningen," one of Van Gogh's earliest works in oil paint, was damaged during its time away from the museum. It is is one of only two seascapes that Van Gogh painted in the Netherlands, according to the museum.
A piece of paint was missing from the bottom left-hand corner, but museum conservators filled it using a 3D-printed mould replicating the original brushstrokes. The piece had likely torn off when the painting was removed from its frame, the museum said.
