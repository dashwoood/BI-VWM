Is it working?
While WhatsApp said its moves had decreased forwarded messages by 25%, fact-checkers at other organisations say fake news is still rampant. And they are frustrated that the same rumours and conspiracy theories that they have already debunked - that the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty have Muslim roots, for example - keep resurfacing.

They say that unless WhatsApp changes its stance on encryption and privacy, the introduction of features similar to those that exist on Facebook - for example, flagging debunked content to users who try to forward it - is impossible.
