The basic characters are taken from Shakespeare’s famous play “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” However, in this story the plot and the concept are entirely different. Titania and Oberon are the rulers of fairies who have been dealing with problems in their marriage. One day they find a human child and decide to adopt him. They hope that this child will help them save their relationship.

However, the child develops a deadly disease and the fairies have no idea what to do since they have never known illness or death. This is a tragic tale about how they try to understand something they have never seen before and their deep love for a stranger who is so unlike them.

What Is Great About It: The story is able to explore human relationships through imaginary creatures. It explores the grief of parenthood and also the uncertainty of knowing whether your child will ever even know you. It also beautifully captures the sense of the unknown and the helplessness which every human being faces in front of it.
