The New IRA has admitted responsibility for the murder of journalist Lyra McKee, according to the Irish News.

In a statement given to the paper the group offered "full and sincere apologies" to her family and friends.

Ms McKee, 29, was shot in the head on Thursday night while observing rioting in Londonderry's Creggan estate.

On Tuesday police confirmed the arrest of a 57-year-old woman in connection with Ms McKee's death. The woman was arrested under the Terrorism Act.

Police say there has been a "massive response" to her killing and have urged more members of the public to come forward.

The statement from the New IRA comes after the hard-left republican political party Saoradh - which has the support of the New IRA - had previously sought to justify the use of violence on Thursday.

Susan McKay, journalist and friend of Ms McKee, said there was no apology capable of covering the appalling action.

"They need to disband. There isn't any apology that is good enough," she told the BBC.
