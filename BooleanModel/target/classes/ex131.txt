Just then the door flew open.  In marched the Seven Dwarfs, home from the day's work.  Shocked they were indeed, to find Snow White lying on the floor and what must be her step-mother beside her, laughing!

They chased the Queen out the door, and into the storm.  Up to the top of a mountain they chased her.  All of a sudden, lightning hit the mountain!  The Queen fell and was never seen again.

But there was nothing to help poor Snow White.  She stayed absolutely still in her deep sleep.  The Seven Dwarfs gently lifted her into a glass coffin.  Day and night they kept watch over her.

One day, the Prince happened to pass through.  Ever since he had learned that Snow White was missing at the castle, he was searching for her, far and wide.  Now he finally found at last, but in such a state! The Prince pulled open the glass coffin.  Her face seemed so fresh, even in that deep sleep.  He leaned toward her and brushed his lips to hers, ever so lightly.

Then at once Snow White’s eyes opened!  With Love’s First Kiss, the evil Queen’s spell had been broken!  Now nothing stood in the way for Snow White and the Prince to be together forever.  They returned to the kingdom and lived happily ever after.
