North Korean state media has confirmed that leader Kim Jong-un will travel to Russia "soon" for his first ever meeting with Vladimir Putin.

While no date has been announced, the Kremlin has also said the two will meet "in the second half of April".

Speculation is growing that they'll meet in Russia's eastern port of Vladivostok, just hours from their shared border, later this week.

It comes soon after the collapse of the Trump-Kim talk in Hanoi.

But both sides will be bringing very different agendas to the table.
