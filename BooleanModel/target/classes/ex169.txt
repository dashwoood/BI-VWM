It added: "We would also like to note our love and appreciation to our mother, Liz, for the care, devotion and love she gave to our father throughout his illness. No one could have done any more.

"Whilst this is a very sad time for all the family and we know our privacy will be respected, our father always made time for the supporters so please tell his stories, sing his songs and help us celebrate his life."

Big goals in big games - McNeill the player
Born in Bellshill, North Lanarkshire, McNeill was initially farmed out by Celtic to junior side Blantyre Victoria before making his debut on 23 August 1958.

More than 800 appearances later, the Scottish Cup final win against Airdrie on 3 May 1975 was the imposing centre-back's farewell game.

Among his many career highs was scoring the winner in the 1965 Scottish Cup final, ending an eight-year trophy drought for Celtic. He also found the net in the 1969 and 1972 finals.

The European Cup final of 1967 was the pinnacle, coming in the same season Celtic won a domestic treble, but he was on the losing side three years later when Feyenoord beat Celtic in Milan after extra-time.

He was capped 29 times for Scotland.
