US President Donald Trump has been accused of trying to "slut shame" a female senator who demanded he quit over sexual misconduct claims.

Mr Trump claimed Kirsten Gillibrand had come "begging" to him for donations and "would do anything" for cash.

Senator Elizabeth Warren said Mr Trump was "trying to bully, intimidate and slut-shame" her fellow Democrat.

The White House dismissed claims that the remarks were sexist, adding that he was referring to political corruption.

"There's no way that this is sexist at all. This is simply talking about a system that we have which is broken", White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Tuesday.

Mrs Sanders said the comments had "the same sentiment that the president has expressed many times before when he has exposed the corruption of the entire political system".

She added that he has used "similar terminology many times" to discuss both men and women, adding that "politicians repeatedly beg for money".

Scores of Democratic congresswomen are urging Congress to investigate claims against the Republican president.

Three of his accusers held a press conference on Monday to repeat their allegations he groped, fondled, forcibly kissed and harassed them.
