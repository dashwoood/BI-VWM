Aides to Ukraine's President-elect Volodymyr Zelensky have announced anti-corruption plans, including scrapping MPs' immunity from prosecution and making military purchases transparent.

Halyna Yanchenko, a top official at the anti-corruption watchdog Nabu, said "MPs' immunity must be consigned to the past". She spoke on Hromadske TV.

Aide Ivan Aparshyn said state defence orders "will be as open as possible".

Mr Zelensky, a popular comedian, won with 73% of the vote on Sunday.

He made tackling Ukraine's deep-rooted corruption a major campaign theme, though his political agenda is generally not very detailed.
