The AK Party says invalid votes across polling stations have jeopardised the result, calling it "the biggest stain in Turkish democratic history".

"Of course I don't agree," says Mr Imamoglu.

"Up until yesterday, the government and the ruling party were claiming that Turkey had the most credible voting system and they were giving it the highest praise. One million people were on duty at polling stations that night.

"If there was any suspicious activity, they would record it and make a written report - that's the official procedure here.

"Now the only explanation I have is that they are making excuses for their failure."

The challenge by the government has led to allegations of hypocrisy. It denied the opposition the right to challenge the disputed local election result in Ankara in 2014.

And in the 2017 referendum on changing Turkey's political system to favour President Erdogan, the state-run election board ruled during counting that unstamped ballot papers would be accepted.
