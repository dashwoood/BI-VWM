What next?
The draft bill will most likely be voted on in parliament next month.

Singapore's ruling party, the PAP, has been in power since independence in 1965. It controls at least 80% of the seats in parliament, so it is almost certain the bill will become law.

When it does, the next step is to watch how Singapore uses this law in practice. Rights groups point to previous cases which they say show the Singapore government's sensitivity to criticism, and say that sets a worrying precedent for how this law may be used.

The bill is also being pushed through ahead of widely expected elections which it is thought will be held soon.

"This is politically driven," says Phil Robertson, of Human Rights Watch. "A government heading to an election...they are worried. Singapore is using this law to set themselves up as the lord and master of what is right on the internet."

Still, some legal experts say the law has the potential to add clarity to matters of public debate, and should not be seen as something sinister.

"There is a pragmatic streak in the law," says Eugene Tan, Associate Professor of Law at Singapore Management University.

"It seeks to have the government's version of the facts and its side of the story known. When it becomes law, the content producer and/or the online platforms will have to carry the competing narratives."

Regulating fake news is necessary. And how Singapore is proposing to tackle this will be watched closely in other Asian capitals. But laws should be designed to protect citizens - that includes from the potential abuse of government.

No government is perfect, but Singapore's approach may depend far too much on the benevolence of those in power.
