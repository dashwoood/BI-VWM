All of Gujarat is voting today
Mr Modi may not be on the ballot but there is still a lot interest in various seats - including Gandhinagar, where party president Amit Shah is contesting.

Among those hoping to unseat him is Vejli Rathod, a Dalit (formerly untouchable) man who says he is still waiting for charges to be brought following his son's death in a police shooting back in 2012.

Fed up, he decided to run against Mr Shah, one of India's most powerful politicians.

"Victory may come and go, but I am fighting against Amit Shah for justice," Mr Rathod told BBC Gujarati.
