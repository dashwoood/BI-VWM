A microphone and sound processor unit worn on the side of the head then transmits sound to the implant.

This electrical stimulation can provide auditory sensations, but it cannot promise to restore normal hearing.

However, Prof Dan Jiang, consultant otologist and clinical director of the Hearing Implant Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, said some children can develop a degree of speech.

"The outcomes are variable. Some will do better than others," he said.

"They have to adapt to it and younger children do better so we like to insert the implant early if possible."

Children under five are best placed to learn new concepts of sound and respond to intensive therapy, he said.

Susan Daniels, chief executive of the National Deaf Children's Society, said: "Every deaf child is different and for some, technology like auditory brainstem implants can be the right option and can make a huge difference to their lives.

"With the right support, deaf children can achieve just as well as their hearing peers and this investment is another important step towards a society where no deaf child is left behind."
