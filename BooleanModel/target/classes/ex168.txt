Legendary former Celtic captain Billy McNeill - the first Briton to lift the European Cup - has died aged 79.

McNeill led Celtic when they beat Inter Milan 2-1 in 1967 and captained the club to nine successive titles, seven Scottish Cups and six League Cups.

In two spells as Celtic boss, he won four titles and four cups. He managed Clyde, Aberdeen, Manchester City and Aston Villa too.

McNeill had been suffering from dementia since 2010.
