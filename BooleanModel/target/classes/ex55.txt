A British woman was one of two people shot dead by gunmen who stormed a holiday resort in Nigeria.

The woman was named by her employers as Faye Mooney from Manchester.

A Mercy Corps statement said the 29-year-old had been working for them in Nigeria, but was on holiday when she was "tragically killed" in the northern city of Kaduna.

Ms Mooney's family said they were "so proud of who she was", adding: "Her memory will always be cherished."

"Faye was an inspiration to her family, friends, students and work colleagues," the family said. "Her bravery and her belief in a better society took her to places others feared."

Local police said a Nigerian man was also killed, and three others were kidnapped during the attack on Friday.

Kidnapping for ransom is common in Nigeria, with foreigners and high-profile Nigerians frequently targeted.
