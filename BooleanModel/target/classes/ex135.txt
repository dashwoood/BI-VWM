After a 14-year search and an investigation into a group linked to the Italian mafia, authorities recovered the paintings in Italy in 2016.
Museum staff spent two years examining the damage to the paintings and restoring them. On Wednesday, they hung them up again in the museum's galleries.
"We are delighted to be able to put these significant works in our collection back on display in the museum, where they belong," museum director Axel Ruger said in a statement.
"The conservators have done a brilliant job and the paintings will now go back on permanent display in their full glory, for everyone to see."
