And in Scotland, people showed their displeasure, both in Edinburgh and at Turnberry.

The National Police Chiefs' Council estimated that the police operation for the president's 2018 visit cost nearly 18m.

It said 10,000 officers from across the country were needed to cover the occasion.

The campaigners behind the 2018 protests - the Stop Trump coalition and Stand Up To Trump - have vowed to mobilise "huge numbers" once again in response to the visit.

A spokeswoman for Commons Speaker John Bercow said a request for Mr Trump to address Parliament would be "considered in the usual way", but did not say whether a request had yet been received.

Mr Bercow previously said he would be "strongly opposed" to Mr Trump addressing the Houses of Parliament during a state visit.
